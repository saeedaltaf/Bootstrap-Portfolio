                    My name is Saeed Altaf, and I am seeking an opportunity in Web Development or Software Development
                    (front-end, back-end or full-stack) where I can continue to grow my passion and skillset in the
                    industry. Over my 7 year work history, I have a proven track record of growth and development, not
                    only for myself, but also for the teams I have been a part of.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently pursuing a Full-Stack Development Certificate from Georgia Tech. Here, I was able to
                    pick up many skills, including:

                <p>
                    During this time, I have developed and deployed several projects, which can be viewed on the
                    "Portfolio" link at the top!
                </p>
                <p>
                    To provide a little more background on my career, which allowed me to pursue my passion of becoming
                    a Developer,s I had obtained my Bachelor's in Accounting and
                    Information Management from the University of Texas at Dallas. From there, I was quickly able to
                    apply my knowledge of MIS and used VBA to help grow my knowledge of the industry. In my accounting
                    career, I helped to streamline month end close and financial reporting processes which helped me
                    climb the ladder into a senior level position.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point, I was looking for a new challenge, so I left accounting and started from the bottom
                    and became an Over the Road Truck Driver! My goal was to start my own, self-sufficient logistics
                    company. Over the last couple of years, I was able to grow my company, Grand Trunk Express, to a
                    fleet of 4 trucks, 4 employees, and a couple of trust freight brokers! Within the past few months,
                    this has become a very hands-off, self-sufficient business, and this is what helped open the door
                    for me to pursue my true passion of becoming a developer!
                </p>
